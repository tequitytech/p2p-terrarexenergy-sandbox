== E01: Auto-fix safe lint violations ==
Date: 2026-02-08
Status: DONE

What was done:
- Ran `npx eslint --fix .` (2 passes needed to stabilize)
- Auto-fixed 293 violations across 4 rules:
  - import-x/order: import statement reordering
  - @typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports: value→type import conversion
  - sonarjs/unused-import: removed unused imports
  - prefer-const: let→const for never-reassigned variables

Results:
- Before: 3,771 problems (2,917 errors, 854 warnings)
- After:  3,478 problems (2,630 errors, 848 warnings)
- Reduction: 293 violations fixed (expected ~277, got slightly more)
- Build: PASSES (npm run build)
- Lint: runs without crashes (remaining violations are expected)

Notes for next person:
- There are 2 remaining sonarjs/unused-import fixable errors in src/webhook/routes.ts
  (Request, Response imports). These can't auto-fix because @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
  also flags them. They'll be resolved in E03 (unused vars manual fix).
- Next task is E02 (verify tests pass) or E03 (manual unused-vars fixes).
